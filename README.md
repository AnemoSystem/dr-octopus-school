<h1> Dr. Octopus School üêô</h1>
A game designed for students and teachers who are interesteds in a faster way to communicate between each other. <br>
This school game and all his components were our Final Paper project, focused to make students life easier. <br><br>

<h2> About our project </h2>
The idea of the game was created by PlopesK, followed by all members aprovance. <br>
It would be a project focused on manking a game integrated with a school system. <br>
All game elements were inspired by a browser game called "Club Penguin", with sadly isn't acessible by the public anymore, since it was close... <br><br>

<h2> Game Mechanics </h2>
The game contain a lot of mechanics, such as customization, many minigames, the hability to talk in a chat or via letters, being able to acess your grades and even comunicate with the school!<br>
Since the idea was to only being able to enter using an created account, the system would only allow the school to create their students accounts (to create a safier place and easier to moderate).<br><br>

<h2> Conclusion </h2>
Gladly, the public loved our project :) <br>
Plus, we had a lot of fun working on it!<br>
And even better, we learned a lot! Both about how to work alongside team members and about organizaing ourselves inside projects!<br>
<s>Alongside some programming lessons</s>
